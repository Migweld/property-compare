                Leedsvlondon.com is a small side project we made for fun inspired by the
                <a href='http://www.londontoleeds.com/'>London to Leeds</a>
                initiative. We built this in around 2 days, it has absolutely not been fully tested and it may well break so soz if it does.
            </p>
            <p>This site was made for a bit of a laugh, it is NOT a serious property searching tool and you should absolutely not use it to find your next home. We know we're not compairing apples with apples, please do not send us tweets or emails about the results you get. Do however have a chuckle at how ludicrously over priced London property is. Cheers!</p>
